Web-based Machine Learning:
- Based on TensorFlowJS
- Provides inference and training
- Private-oriented (data do not leave the device)
- No installation needed (only a modern browser is needed)
- https://pbizopoulos.github.io/web-based-machine-learning

End-user instructions:
1) Visit https://pbizopoulos.github.io/web-based-machine-learning/ .
2) Select the model depending on your task.
3) Load your data.
4) Predict.
5) Correct the results if needed.
6) Train only if correction took place.
7) Save the predictions.

AI model development instructions:
1) Develop and train a model in TensorFlowJS, Tensorflow or PyTorch having the following considerations in mind:
- fast inference (<1 second/data sample is recommended) and
- small size (100MB max for a saved model is recommended).
2) Convert the model to TensorFlowJS.
- For TensorFlow https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_saved_model
- For PyTorch https://github.com/pbizopoulos/comprehensive-comparison-of-deep-learning-models-for-lung-and-covid-19-lesion-segmentation-in-ct/blob/becf52d7cdb74eaad994fda2bba503460857e386/main.py#L582
3) Test the converted model by applying inference on a data sample.
4) Prepare a configuration json file as follows:
e.g.https://github.com/pbizopoulos/tmp/raw/main/lung-classification.json
{
	"classNames": ["Array that", "contains", "the names of the classes"],
	"exampleDataUrl": "Optional: URL or local file of an example data of this model",
	"loss": "Optional: loss used for training (can be any of https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#Training-Losses)",
	"machineLearningType": "type of machine learning algorithm for the model (can be any of 'image classification', 'image segmentation')",
	"metrics": ["Optional: can be any of https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#Metrics"],
	"modelDownloadUrl": "URL or local filepath of model.json",
	"modelUploadUrl": "Optional: URL of remote server or local directory",
	"name": "name of the configuration (e.g. indicate imaging modality and disease)",
	"optimizer": "Optional: optimizer used for training (can be any of https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#Training-Optimizers)",
	"projectUrl": "Optional: URL of the project that has created the model"
}
5) Test on a local server by using the local links in the configuration json file.
6) Convert the local links to remote links in the configuration json file.
7) Upload the model (model.json and shard files), the example data and the configuration json file on a server (e.g. GitHub, AWS etc.).
8) Create a pull request on https://github.com/pbizopoulos/web-based-machine-learning that adds the raw URL of the configuration json file.
